# TheRecipeProgram
Implements the self-balancing binary tree data structure, this Java program stores recipes and will create a shopping list of ingredients if user plans to make a certain recipe.

In this program, the user can save and load their recipe database. When creating a recipe, the user can add name, prep time, cook time, description, ingredients, category, and a picture. They can add, edit and delete any recipe from the database. If the user decides they want to make a certain recipe, they need only to add to the shopping list and all ingredients will then appear in the official shopping list. Double-clicking the ingredient in the shopping list will change its status to "bought."
